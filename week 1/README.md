## Week 1 Assessment
## Lab Title: Variable Assignment and Data Types in Python
# The objective of this lab is to understand:

What variables are in Python

The rules for naming variables

How to assign values to variables

How to check data types

Basic sequence types (List, Tuple, Range)

This lab builds foundational knowledge for programming and machine learning.
## Tools Used
Google Colab
## Step-by-Step Process
# Understanding Variables

1. We learned that variables are containers used to store data values.

2. We also learned the rules:

3. Must start with a letter or underscore (_)

4. Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores

5. Cannot start with a number
# Variable Assignment
We assigned a string value to a variable:
Firstname = "Natalie"
print(Firstname)
Output:
Natalie
# Checking Data Types
We created variables with different data types:
x = 2
y = 3.14
z = 2 + 3j

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))
Output:
<class 'int'>
<class 'float'>
<class 'complex'>
This helped us understand how Python identifies different data types.
#  Understanding Sequences
We explored sequence types in Python:
mylist_ = [1,2,3,4,5]
mytuple = (1,2,3,4,5)
myrange = range(1,5)
Types of sequences covered:
List
Tuple
Range
# Commands Executed
Variable assignment
print()
type()
Creating lists, tuples, and ranges
# Key Observations
Variables must follow strict naming rules.

Python automatically detects data types.

The type() function is useful for debugging.

Lists, tuples, and ranges are basic but important data structures.

Understanding data types is essential for machine learning.
